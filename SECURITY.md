Please include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce

- Potential impact
- Proof-of-concept (if available)

Reports that lack sufficient detail may be ignored.

## Disclosure Policy

We follow a **responsible disclosure** process:

1. You report the vulnerability privately
2. We acknowledge receipt within **72 hours**
3. We investigate and validate the issue
4. We release a fix as soon as reasonably possible
5. Public disclosure happens **after** a fix is available

Do **not** publicly disclose vulnerabilities before coordination. Doing so may result in your report being rejected.
